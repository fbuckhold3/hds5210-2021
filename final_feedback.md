Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

Nicely put together.  It was a pleasure to read through and easily see your thought process.

One tip with reading in data with Pandas.  You can specify column data types when you use the read_xyz() functions.  The dtypes or converters parameter will allow you to do that.  It's very handy for things like npi that Pandas will try to convert to numeric values, where you really want those to stay strings.  That said, I like the care you took to make sure everything was cleanly the data type that you wanted it to be.

I really enjoyed working with you on access the NPI registry website.  Thank you for making this project so practical and asking for help.  I didn't mind and it was clear that it helped you both learn more and make use of your learning.
